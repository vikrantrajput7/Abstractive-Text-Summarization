# Multi-Input Neural Abstractive Text Summarization with Multi-Output

## Introduction

In the modern era of big data, millions of articles, blogs, news reports are generated every
minute. It becomes very difficult to get crucial information from these documents in a very
short time. Automatic text summarization plays an important role in getting information
very quickly from these documents. Text summarization is the task of producing the sum-
mary of the long textual document in such a way that the summary contains the useful and
important information of that textual document.
A news article example is shown in image below.

### Types of Text Summarization
<p>
<b>1. Extractive Text Summarization</b> <br>
In Extractive Text Summarization, the summary is generated by selecting the important parts
from the source documents such as specific words, phrases, and sentences and then merging
them together to create a coherent summary.
Example : Vikrant went to NLP LAB. There, he setup his system.
Extractive Summary : Vikrant went NLP LAB setup his system.
In the above example, important words are selected and merged to generate the extractive
summary. <br><br>
<b>2. Abstractive Text Summarization</b> <br>
Abstractive Text Summarization compress and paraphrases the source document without los-
ing their semantic meaning and produce a high-quality summary.
Example : Vikrant went to NLP LAB. There, he setup his system.
Abstractive Summary : Vikrant visited NLP LAB to ready the system.
In the above example, sentences are compressed and paraphrased to generate the abstractive
summary.
